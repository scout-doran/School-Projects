In this lab, you will practice creating/instantiating objects and passing messages to them.
Four short, unrelated exercises will review basic programming concepts (conditionals and loops)
and provide substantial practice in using objects.
<b>You will also become familiar with using the javadoc external documentation format</b>,
which will be a very valuable skill this semester.

<b>Part I: Solving simultaneous equations using the matrix package</b>
<p>

Download the following file:

<p>
<b>package matrix</b><br>
<ul>
   <li><a href="Lab02/matrix.jar">matrix.jar</a></li>
   <li><a href="Lab02/make.bat">make.bat</a>  //for those unable to set the PATH and CLASSPATH environment variables</li>
</ul>

<p>

Consider the following set of equations: <br>
1.6x<sub>1</sub> + 2.4x<sub>2</sub> - 3.7x<sub>3</sub> = -22.10 <br>
17.6x<sub>1</sub> - 5.6x<sub>2</sub> + 0.05x<sub>3</sub> = -4.35 <br>
-2x<sub>1</sub> + 2x<sub>2</sub> + 25.3x<sub>3</sub> = 233.70 <br>

<p>

These equations can be represented in matrix form as Ax = b where A is a 3x3 matrix of the coefficients,
x is a 3x1 matrix of the unknown values, and b is a 3x1 matrix of the right hand sides (RHS).
This matrix equation can be inverted to solve for the unknowns, x = A<sup>-1</sup>b.

<p>

Use the matrix package (in the jar file, don't extract the files) 
and the associated external documentation to solve the above system of equations.
You will need to use the import statement and -classpath (or -cp) to compile and run
so that you can access the classes in the jar file.  You may want to consider
using a batch file to speed up compiling and running with a custom classpath.

<p>

Declare your matrix variables to be type <b>MatrixOperationsInterface</b>.

<p>

Call your driver <b>Equations.java</b>.

<p>

<b>Part II: Computing the percentage of times that craps is rolled</b>

<p>

Download the following files: <br>

<ul>
   <li><a href="Lab02/SingleDie.class">SingleDie.class</a> //you won't directly use this class, representing a six-sided die</li>
   <li><a href="Lab02/CrapsDice.class">CrapsDice.class</a> //has the following public interface:</li>
   <ul>
      <li>public CrapsDice() //constructor (creates and uses 2 SingleDie objects, this is called composition or <b>has-a</b>)</li>
      <li>public int roll()  //rolls two SingleDies (six-sided dies) and returns the result</li>
   </ul>
</ul>

<p>

Roll the dice 752 times and report the percentage of times that a 2, 3, or 12 is rolled (one number).
You will need to <b>cast to a double</b> to get the correct percentage (or you will be performing integer division).
Call your driver class <b>Craps.java</b> and include the following static method: <br>

<ul>
   <li>public static int playCraps(int numberOfRolls) //returns the number of times that a 2, 3, or 12 is rolled</li>
</ul>

      <li>public void guess(int tryPassword, int matches) //index in list of possible passwords of attempted word (<b>1-based</b>), number of matches reported</li>
      <li>public int getNumberOfPasswordsLeft() //returns the number of possible passwords remaining-- when only one password remains, the program terminates</li>
      <li>public String toString() //display the updated list of possible passwords</li>
      <li>public String getOriginalWord(int index)  //1-based</li>
      <li>public String getViableWord(int index)  //1-based</li>
      <li>public int bestGuess() //returns the index of the word in the <b>original list</b> that should be the next guessed password</li>

   <li><a href="Lab02/Keyboard.class">Keyboard.class</a> //has the following public interface:</li>
   <ul>
      <li>public static int readInt(String prompt)  //static methods are called using the class name</li>
      <li>public static double readDouble(String prompt)</li>
      <li>public static String readString(String prompt)</li>
   </ul>
</ul>

<p>

In Fallout 3, sometimes it is necessary to hack computers.  
When hacking is attempted (assuming your science skill is high enough to even attempt the hack), 
you are given a list of possible passwords.  
Each time you try a password from the list, either it is the correct password and you are granted access to the computer,
or you are told how many characters in the attempted word match characters in the actual password.  <b>The character
and its position in the actual password must match</b>.  
By a process of elimination, it is then possible to determine the actual password. 
You have 4 tries to determine the correct password.

<p>

Allow the user to enter possible passwords (<b>Strings</b>) from the Keyboard 
(refer to the Java API for the String class public interface, look for the &quot;equals&quot; method).  
The user will enter &quot;q&quot; when they are done
entering possible passwords.  Next, they will enter which word that they tried as the password, and the number of
character matches reported by Fallout 3.  The updated list of possible passwords is displayed, and the user is then able
to guess another password from this updated list.  If only one password remains, the program terminates.
Your program should be able to handle special cases (i.e. entering &quot;q&quot; right away).

<p>

Call your driver class <b>PasswordDriver.java</b>.  Include the following static methods: <br>

<ul>
   <li>public static void addWords(?)</li>
   <li>public static void guessWords(?)</li>
</ul>

<b>Part IV: Using a priority queue to sort CDs (heap sort)</b>
<p>

Download the following file:

<ul>
   <li><a href="Lab02/CD.class">CD.class</a> //has the following public interface:</li>
      <ul>
         <li>public CD (String title, String artist, double value, int tracks)</li>
         <li>public String toString() //returns the state of the CD as a String</li>
      </ul>
</ul>

<p>

Suppose you want to sort a set of CDs (by title).  One possible way to do this is to use a priority queue.
The &quot;Java Collections Framework&quot; includes a priority queue
(refer to the Java API for the public interface and look for &quot;offer&quot; and &quot;poll&quot;).  
You will need to import this class (java.util.PriorityQueue).
Use this priority queue to sort the CDs listed below.
That is, put all of the CDs into the priority queue, 
and then pull them out, calling the toString() method on each CD as
it comes off of the priority queue.
As the priority queue is implemented with a heap, you are performing <b>heap sort</b>.  
<b>Is this sort stable?  How can you tell?</b>
 
<p>

Call your driver <b>PQDriver.java</b> and include the following static methods: <br>
<ul>
   <li>public static CD createCD(String title, String artist) //create and return a CD but assign a default value ($14.99) and a default number of tracks (10) to each CD</li>
   <li>public static void insertCD(PriorityQueue pq, CD cd) //put the CD on the priority queue</li>
</ul>

<p>

Add the following CDs to the priority queue in the given order (you can copy and paste this code into your main method):

<p>

      insertCD(pq, createCD("The Gallery", "Dark Tranquillity")); <br>
      insertCD(pq, createCD("Since the Day It All Came Down", "Insomnium")); <br>
      insertCD(pq, createCD("If Emotions Still Burn", "Ablaze My Sorrow")); <br>
      insertCD(pq, createCD("Swamplord", "Kalmah")); <br>
      insertCD(pq, createCD("Towards the Twilight", "Night in Gales"));  <br>
      insertCD(pq, createCD("An Epic Defiance", "Detonation")); <br>
      insertCD(pq, createCD("From Your Grave", "The Absence")); <br>
      insertCD(pq, createCD("Inhumanity", "Mors Principium Est")); <br>
      insertCD(pq, new CD("The Gallery", "Dark Tranquillity", 13.99, 11));  //a &quot;duplicate&quot; with a different value and tracks  <br>
      insertCD(pq, createCD("Timeless Departure", "Skyfire")); <br>
      insertCD(pq, createCD("Spirits and August Light", "Omnium Gatherum")); <br>
      insertCD(pq, createCD("Slaughter of the Soul", "At the Gates")); <br>
      insertCD(pq, createCD("Shadows and Dust", "Kataklysm")); <br>
      insertCD(pq, createCD("Fate of Norns", "Amon Amarth")); <br>
      insertCD(pq, createCD("Corroding From Inside", "Searing Meadow")); <br>
      insertCD(pq, createCD("The Glorious Burden", "Iced Earth")); <br>
      insertCD(pq, createCD("Stained", "Imperanon")); <br>
      insertCD(pq, createCD("As Night Conquers Day", "Autumn Leaves")); <br>

In this lab, you will be designing and implementing the model portion of the Model-View-Controller
design pattern.  You will need a set of classes (a model) to allow the LabManager GUI to track
the progress of CSC 2121 lab students throughout the semester.  

<p>

The number of CSC 2121 sections that the LabManager will be working with is specified in the main method.
In this lab, there will be two sections.
Each section will have a different number of students, with the data for each section read in from
and stored to a separate text file.  The text file will store (in a comma delimited file)
student ID, student name, lab grade and partner ID for each completed lab (14 total).
A student is assigned a random partner each lab period.
An odd number of students present for a given lab will result in one randomly chosen student 
as their own partner.
If a student is present for the lab and works on the lab with their partner for the entire
class, that student (and partner) receives a default 'D' for the lab, 
even if the lab is not complete or has several major issues.  
Completion of the lab before the final due date specified in the syllabus results in an A, B, C, or D
depending on how many major or minor issues are still present in the final lab submission.  

<p>

From the CSC 2121 syllabus:<br>

<p>

Interpreting your ilearn grade:<br>
<ul>
   <li>A: lab completed with no issues (1.00 points)</li>
   <li>B: lab completed with a few minor issues (0.75 points)</li>
   <li>C: lab completed with a few major issues (0.50 points)</li>
   <li>D: lab not completed or several major issues (0.25 points)</li>
   <li>F: lab not attended or not working with partner (0.00 points)</li>
   <ul>  
      <li><b>if you have 2 or more Fs, you cannot pass lab</b></li>
   </ul>
</ul>

<p>

Final Grade:<br>
<ul>
   <li>A: >= 13.25 points</li>
   <li>B: >= 11.00 points</li>
   <li>C: >= 8.50 points</li>
   <li>D: >= 4.50 points</li>
</ul>

<p>

<b>Part I: Class Cohesion and Separation of Responsibilities</b>

<p>

Most of the work for the actual GUI has been completed for you.  Thus, your model
must interface with the GUI using the protocol listed in Part II.
This means that your model will include, at a minimum, a <b>Sections</b> class.

<p>

Try to determine what minimal set of classes that you need to perform the duties described 
at the top of the lab.
You are only concerned with the classes required to store the data (the model), not the GUI.
Remember that classes have knowing, doing, or controlling responsibilities (separation of
responsibilities).  The Expert
pattern also suggests that classes responsible for knowing data should manipulate it (so
some classes may have both knowing and doing responsibilities).
Make sure that you adhere to the <b>Law of Demeter</b> in your design, and consider
any additional classes that may be needed for proper class cohesion.

<p>

Before looking at my starting classes below,
draw a UML diagram of your design, showing class relationships and instance variables (you may omit methods).

<p>

Download the following files: <br>
<ul>
   <li><a href = "Lab13/Random.java">Random.java</a>  //no work</li>
   <li><a href = "Lab13/Lab.java">Lab.java</a>  //no work</li>

</ul>

<p>

Compare your UML diagram to the above classes.  Is your design more elegant or less elegant?
Argue for or against a different number of classes in your model hierarchy on your UML diagram.

<p>

<b>Part II: Model and Law of Demeter</b>

<p>

Using the classes provided in the previous part,
implement the following public interface for a <b>Sections</b> 
class so that it can interact with the GUI (<b>some of these methods may have been completed for you</b>):

<p>

<ul>
   <li>Sections(int num_sections, double[] grade_constants, int total_num_labs) //constructor</li>

   <li>int getNumSections()</li>
   <li>int getNumStudents(int sectionID)  //the number of students in a given section</li>
   <li>int getNumLabs(int sectionID)  //the number of labs completed by the class for a given section</li>
   <li>int getNumLabs(int sectionID, int studentID)  //the number of labs completed by an individual student</li>
   <li>int getPartnerID(int sectionID, int studentID, int labID)  //a student's partner for a given lab (note consistent parameter ordering)</li>
   <li>String getStudentName(int sectionID, int studentID)</li>
   <li>boolean isPresent(int sectionID, int studentID, int labID)</li>

   <li>String studentInfo(int sectionID, int studentID) //all lab grades for a single student (used in top text box in GUI)</li>
   <li>String partnerList(int sectionID, int labID)  //list of partners for the requested lab</li>
   <li>void computePartners(int sectionID)  //randomly assign partners for the lab</li>

   <li>boolean isActive(int sectionID, int studentID)  //is student still in the class?</li>
   <li>void setInactive(int sectionID, int studentID)  //student has withdrawn</li>
   <li>void setNotPresent(int sectionID, int studentID, int labID)  //student absent for lab (simply set the lab grade to F)</li>
   <li>void setGrade(int sectionID, int studentID, int labID, char grade)  //update the student's grade for the lab (and partner's)</li>

   <li>void addLab(int sectionID)  //starting a new lab</li>
   <li>void writeFiles()</li>

   <li><b>can you identify any additional essential methods to form a complete protocol?</b></li>
   <li><b>add at least one convenience method (calls essential methods to perform a task)</b></li>
</ul>

<b>Note: IDs passed as parameters are 1-based!</b>

<p>

Note that the method signatures (studentID and labID passed as parameters with a consistent ordering) 
imply that the Law of Demeter is followed by the GUI.  That is, instead of obtaining a reference
to a student and then obtaining a reference to a particular lab, the GUI passes the student and lab IDs
as parameters, and lets the classes that control the relevant data handle the request.

<p>

Even though the GUI
uses defensive programming before calling the above methods, your methods should
check that the parameters are valid (preconditions are met) before proceeding.
To save time, you may use simple error checking (error codes or default values) rather
than exception handling.  Methods that have several parameters should have their parameters
verified in different classes.

<b>Part III: View-Controller</b>

<p>

Identify the view and controller portions of the M-V-C design pattern.
Note how the controller is registered with the view (Observer design pattern).

<p>

<b>Complete the processGrade method</b>.  To correctly set a grade,
both the student selected and their partner must have the grade set.

- Inspect the state of a repository
- Undo a commit

## Targeted Process Skills

- Critical thinking

## Contents

- activity.md - Primary activity that students work together to complete
- cheatsheet.md - Contains common command-line commands, vim commands, and other resources
- presentation.pptx - Provides a little context

## Facilitation

- 10 min:
  - Provide overview using presentation.pptx
  - Form teams
  - Handout cheatsheet.md and activity.md, one copy per team
- 30-50 min: Supervise teams as they work through activity.md
- 5-10 min: Discuss responses to key questions; this can be done along the way

## FAQ

Here are some common questions that students may ask.

1. __Why stage?__
    Staging commits gives developers fine-grain control over what to commit. Here are are some references on the subject:
    - https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/69178/what-is-the-benefit-of-gits-two-stage-commit-process-staging
    - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4878358/why-would-i-want-stage-before-committing-in-git
    - http://gitolite.com/uses-of-index.html

2. __What's the difference between  `git add .` and `git add -A .`?__ As of Git 2.0, nothing; they both stage all modifications recursively starting in the current directory.

3. __What is the meaning of HEAD?__ HEAD refers to the branch or commit currently checked out.

4. __What is the meaning of `^` in `HEAD^`?__  "Parent". `HEAD^` is the parent of HEAD.

5. __What's the difference between `git commit -a` and `git add . ; git commit`?__ `git commit -a` will only stage changes in ___tracked___ files. `git add .` adds changes in ___all___ files (that are not ignored). So it will add changes in untracked files too.

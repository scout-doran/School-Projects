#### Pre-work
This laboratory makes use of the [https://codingbat.com/java](https://codingbat.com/java) website, which contains several exercises for practicing programming using Java. The site uses a _Test-Driven Development_ (TDD) approach for programming whereby tests are written first and the goal of the programmer is to make their code pass the test.

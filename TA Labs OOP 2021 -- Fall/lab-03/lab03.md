## Introduction to Java using Codingbat
### CSC 2310

In this lab you will begin learning the Java programming language by writing code using the [codingbat](https://codingbat.com/java) website.

#### Pre-work
This laboratory makes use of the [https://codingbat.com/java](https://codingbat.com/java) website, which contains several exercises for practicing programming using Java. The site uses a _Test-Driven Development_ (TDD) approach for programming whereby tests are written first and the goal of the programmer is to make their code pass the test.

Before starting the lab, go to the above link and create an account using your TNTech account by selecting

### Laboratory Description

After creating and configuring your account (and during the assigned lab period), attempt and complete the following exercises:

* String-1/AtFirst: https://codingbat.com/prob/p139076
* Array-1/Double23: https://codingbat.com/prob/p145365
* Logic-1/FizzString2: https://codingbat.com/prob/p115243

The approach you should use to complete these exercises is the following:

1. Add a return statement to the code block, returning a constant of the given type (e.g., `return true;` for a boolean, `return 0;` for an `int`, etc.)
2. Click the "Go" button to observe the tests fail
3. Write the code to make the tests pass

After the laboratory session, and before the beginning of your next laboratory, you must complete the following exercises:

* String-1/MakeTags: https://codingbat.com/prob/p147483
* Array-1/Reverse3: https://codingbat.com/prob/p112409
* Logic-1/AnswerCell: https://codingbat.com/prob/p110973

In addition, you must complete at least one exercise from at least four of the following categories:

* Array-2
* Array-3
* Logic-2
* String-2
* String-3
* Recursion-1

#### Turn-in

Remember to add your lab instructor to the **Teacher Share** field in the *prefs* menu and your section number to the **Memo** field. **The TA's will create a snapshot of the lab completion report no later than 10 minutes after the assigned laboratory section ends.** You must complete the additional exercises before the end of the next laboratory. 

This laboratory is worth 20 points.
